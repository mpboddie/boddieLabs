So... This is boddieLabs. I am a computer scientist by trade and education, but I tend to tinker A LOT in my personal time. BoddieLabs will be a place for projects that may be related or at least tangentially related to computer science.

On that note, this site is being created using [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), built with [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and hosted on [GitHub](https://www.github.com). So far it is a really great way to host and structure a static site.
